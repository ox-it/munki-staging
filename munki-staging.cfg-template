# Munki Trello Settings
#
# Settings for munki-trello will be read from this file; if not
# specified here, they will take the default value.
#
# Certian values given here can be overwritten on the command line,
#
# The default configuration file locations are:
#    /etc/munki-staging/munki-staging.cfg 
#    ./munki-staging.cfg 
#
# You can add an extra config file location by using the --config 
# command line option. N.B. Configuration files will be processed 
# *before* command line options
#
# This file has the following required sections:
#   * main - main application settings
#   * munki_repo_<name> - the base munki repository 
# Any number of munki repositories can be used; note that each
# repository can only have a single catalog>
# It can have any number of Catalogs which are given in sections:
#   * munki_catalog_<identifier>
# where <identifier> is a suggesitive name for the catalog.
# If no configuration file is given the software will use 
# the default catalogs (but this is not well tested):
#
#   * development - settings about the development board/catalog
#   * testing - settings about the testings board/catalog
#   * production - settings about the production board/catalog
#
# There is a final optional section:
#   * rssfeeds

#
# Munki Catalog Sections
#
# The Munki catalog sections contain information about different Munki
# catalogs and their related Trello lists. This information includes any
# configuration of autostaging, and the setting of due dates.
# 
# You can have any number of these sections 
#
# Below we give an example following the default configiration
# 
#

#[munki_catalog_development]
# The name trello list for development
# Defaults to Development
#list=Development
# The munki repository to use
#munki_repo=software
# The name of the munki catalog for development
# Defaults to development
#catalog=development
# The name of the 'To Development' list in trello
# Defaults to 'To <list>', i.e. 'To Development'
#to_list='To Development'
# If new Trello lists are created when packages are
# moved into this catalog, based on the date the packages are moved
#dated_lists=0


#[munki_catalog_test]
# The name trello list for testing
# Defaults to Testing
#list=Testing
# The munki repository to use
#munki_repo=software
# The name of the munki catalog for testing
# Defaults to test
#catalog=testing
# The name of the 'To Testing' list in trello
# Defaults to 'To <list>', i.e. 'To Testing'
#to_list='To Testing'
# If new Trello lists are created when packages are
# moved into this catalog, based on the date the packages are moved
# Settings for the testing catalog and list
#dated_lists=0


#[munki_catalog_production]
# The name trello list for production
# Defaults to Production
# The munki repository to use
#munki_repo=software
#list=Production
# The name of the munki catalog for production
# Defaults to production
#catalog=production
# The name of the 'To Production' list in trello
# Defaults to 'To <list>', i.e. 'To Production'
#to_list='To Production'
# If new Trello lists are created when packages are
# moved into this catalog, based on the date the packages are moved
# Settings for the production catalog and list
#dated_lists=1


#
# An example configuration with automatic staging and archiving
# of software into a different Munki repositiory
# 
# Firstly, define the additional repository:
#
#[munki_repo_archived]
#repo_path=/Volumes/munki/archived
#
# Then we define 4 catalogs:
#   * unstable
#   * testing
#   * stable
#   * stable
#
#[munki_catalog_development]
# Define the Trello list, accepting the default name for the 'To' list
#list=Unstable
# The Munki repository and catalog to use
#munki_repo=software
#catalog=unstable
# To autostage we need to know how many days we wait before staging
# (based on trello card due date - which can be overwritten by hand)
# and where to stage to
#autostage=1
#stage_days=10
#stage_to=testing
#
#
# The testing catalog
#[munki_catalog_testing]
# Define the trello list, again accepting the default 'To' list
#list=Testing
# The Munki repostiory and catalog:
#munki_repo=software
#catalog=testing
# Turn on autostaging every 10 days:
#autostage=1
#stage_days=10
#stage_to=stable
#
# The Stable catalog - note this doesn't stage as we move
# into the archive by hand
#
#[munki_catalog_production]
#list=Stable
#munki_repo=software
#catalog=stable
#
#autostage=0
#stage_from=testing
#
# Finally the retired catalog, with a different Munki repository
# (perhaps held on slower disks that the main repository)
#[munki_catalog_retired]
#list=Retired
#munki_repo=retired
#catalog=retired
#

#[schedule] 
# The schedule section specifies when autostaging will happen.
# By default, this will be every time the script runs.
# If you add this optional section, autostaging will only happen if
# the script is running in one of the periods defined.
# The optional parameters have the format:
# <Day of Week>=timeperiod[,timeperiod]+
# where <Day of the week> is the long name of the day of the week in the
# current locale and time periods are start ``time-end time`` where each
# time is specified by HH:MM. For example, to only stage on Monday to
# Thursday between 09:00 and 17:00 you have the section:
#Monday=09:00-17:00
#Tuesday=09:00-17:00
#Wednesday=09:00-17:00
#Thursday=09:00-17:00
#
#[schedule_<catalog>]
# As above, but schedule on a per-catalog basis
